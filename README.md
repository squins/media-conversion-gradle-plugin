# Media conversion Gradle plugin

Convert resources from one format to another. 

Various target platforms have different requirements for images, WAVE files, etc. Some examples we use this plugin for:

* Conversion of SVG files to PNG files in different sizes (actual conversion delegated to `inkscape cli`)
* Conversion of uncompressed WAVE files to MP3 (actual conversion delegated to `sox`)
* Conversion of JPG to PNG files (actual conversion delegated to `imagemagick`).
